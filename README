Welcome to Cymbeline, the "yet another web framework which 
			   Python really doesn't need"

Cymbeline was designed not only as a web framework, but rather
a full environment for embedded systems, complete with 
commandline console and the whole nine yards.

Cymbeline today is mainly used for IRM 2 and the Shallot media player.


Cymbeline is (c) 2005 Yann Ramin


There isn't any documentation yet. To see how to use
Cymbeline, look at IRM 2 or Shallot for examples.
